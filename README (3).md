# Exhaustive Analysis of Indian Agriculture Sector Using Power BI

## About the Project
This repository contains the deliverables and learnings from the AICTE Edunet Foundation internship. The primary objective is to analyze the Indian agriculture sector comprehensively and create a Power BI dashboard to present key insights.

## Week 1 Overview
In the first mentoring session, we explored the foundational features of Power BI and performed the following tasks:

### Key Concepts Learned:
- **Power BI Interface**: Familiarized with the blank report, visualization pane, and Home tab.
- **ETL Process**:
  - Extract: Loading data from CSV files.
  - Transform: Cleaning data, removing unnecessary/blank columns, and addressing null values.
  - Load: Preparing cleaned data for visualizations.
- **Power Query Editor**: Used for data preprocessing, including column removal and type adjustment.

### Tasks Performed:
1. Loaded a CSV dataset using the Home tab’s Get Data option.
2. Transformed the dataset in Power Query Editor by:
   - Removing unnecessary and blank columns.
   - Checking for null values and duplicates.
   - Adjusting data types for consistency.
3. Saved and loaded the cleaned dataset for further visualizations.
